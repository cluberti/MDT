Note - the Windows 10 10240 ADK appears to have been removed from the Microsoft download center.
If you already have a copy, fantastic.  If not, it may be available from non-Microsoft sources of questionable legality.

The files should be placed in this folder once the ADK has been downloaded - the files are
WPTx64-x86_en-us.msi and WPTx86-x86_en-us.msi (change languages as appropriate).
These can be found in the download or install location.
