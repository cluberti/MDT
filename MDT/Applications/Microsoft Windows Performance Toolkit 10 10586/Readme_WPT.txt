The Windows Performance Toolkit MSI packages can be downloaded via the Windows 10 ADK:

The files should be placed in this folder once the ADK has been downloaded - the files are
WPTx64-x86_en-us.msi and WPTx86-x86_en-us.msi (change languages as appropriate).
These can be found in the download or install location.
