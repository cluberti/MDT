# MDT
Build script for a basic MDT install

This script is a work-in-progress, but it does work on Server 2012R2 and Windows 10.  I have not tested it downlevel, and I'd wager it probably wouldn't work on 2008R2 or Windows 7.

This script makes some assumptions that you can see when reviewing it - it assumes you will provide a path to a folder that contains ISO files, as well as a folder with custom scripts (if you so choose) and a custom settings.xml file (which I will have in the repository along with some sample custom scripts).  Feedback or changes/fixes always welcome.
